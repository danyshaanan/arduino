### The Toi Lab's Incredible Machine

Arduino script for Team Pellegrino's submission for the Toi Lab's [Incredible Machine](https://www.toilab.org/machine) contest (Purim 2019).

The device contains 12 piezo sensors and a strip of 12 addressable LEDs, operated by the FastLED library ([Installation instructions](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/ese205/core/index.php?title=LED_Control_with_FastLED_Library_%2B_Arduino)), and attached to 12 glass bottles enclosed inside a plastic crate. A golf ball that enters the crate hits the bottles and triggers one of several different shows of colorful moving lights.

The members of Team Pellegrino are Bar Gringauz, Alon Elmaliah, and Dany Shaanan.
